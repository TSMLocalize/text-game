RPG with unique Battle System

This RPG is in the vein of old Final Fantasy games.
However, the idea is to have a complex battle system where the mathematics involved are very visible, so players can make informed choices.
It will have an enmity system, cast-time/interrupt system, 6 party members, 20+ job classes, and a special attack/combo system inspired by Final Fantasy XI's Weaponskills and Magic Bursts.
